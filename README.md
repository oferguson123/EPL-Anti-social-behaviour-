I've recently completed a data analysis project on over 50 instances of anti-social behaviors in various Premier League stadiums. I designed a comprehensive database architecture and Data-Flow-Diagram to manage the database strategically, ensuring insightful outputs and quality assurance. The initiative aims to enhance fan education, improve engagement, facilitate resource allocation, and identify crucial patterns for law enforcement, ultimately fostering a safer and more enjoyable environment in Premier League stadiums.
